const FAQS = [
  {
    q: 'How do I register my team?',
    a: 'Create an account on Zenith Esports, log in, and visit the Tournaments page. Click "Register Now" on an open tournament, fill in your team name, PUBG Mobile character IDs (4–6 players), WhatsApp number, and city, then submit. Your registration will be reviewed by an admin — you\'ll receive a WhatsApp notification once approved or rejected.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Is registration free?',
    a: 'Yes — registration on Zenith Esports is completely free. No entry fees, no hidden charges. We believe competitive opportunity should be available to every Pakistani team regardless of financial background.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How will I know if my team is approved?',
    a: 'You will be notified via your registered WhatsApp number. You can also check your Profile page at any time — your registration status (Pending / Approved / Rejected) is always shown there.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can I submit multiple registrations?',
    a: 'No. Each account can have only one active Pending or Approved registration at a time. This prevents spam and ensures fair access to tournament slots. If your previous registration was rejected, you may register again.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What are the PUBG Mobile ID requirements?',
    a: 'Each player\'s PUBG Mobile Character ID must be unique — duplicate IDs across different team registrations will be flagged and rejected. Enter the in-game Character ID number (numeric), not the username/nickname. Each team requires a minimum of 4 IDs and supports up to 6.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How are groups assigned?',
    a: 'Once the admin approves enough teams, they are automatically partitioned into groups (e.g., Group 1, Group 2 …) of up to 20 teams each. Your group will be visible in your Profile page after assignment, and you\'ll receive a WhatsApp notification.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can I change my player IDs after registering?',
    a: 'Player ID changes are not allowed after submission to maintain fairness. If you made a mistake, contact us on WhatsApp immediately with your team name and the corrected IDs, and an admin will review the request.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What happens if a player drops out?',
    a: 'Contact us on WhatsApp before the tournament starts. A substitute may be allowed depending on the rules of that specific tournament. Substitutions after groups are assigned are generally not permitted.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How is the prize distributed?',
    a: 'Prize money is distributed in PKR via bank transfer or JazzCash / EasyPaisa after the tournament concludes and results are verified. The winning team will be contacted on WhatsApp to confirm and collect bank / wallet details before disbursement.',
  },
  {
    q: 'I forgot my password — how do I reset it?',
    a: 'On the login page, click "Forgot Password" (or use the Magic Link option). Enter your registered email and we will send you a sign-in link. If you do not receive it within 5 minutes, check your spam folder or contact us on WhatsApp.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Google sign-in isn\'t working — what do I do?',
    a: 'Google OAuth may occasionally be unavailable due to configuration windows. Use the "Sign in with Email" (magic link) option instead. If the issue persists, contact us on WhatsApp and include your Google account email so we can investigate.',
  },
  {
    q: 'I face a technical issue on the website — what do I do?',
    a: 'Contact us directly on WhatsApp at +92 339 0715753. Include your registered email, team name, a screenshot if possible, and a description of the problem. We respond Mon–Sun, 12:00 PM – 2:00 AM PKT.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What devices/browsers are supported?',
    a: 'Zenith Esports works on all modern browsers — Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari — on both mobile and desktop. For the best experience, keep your browser updated. If something looks broken, try a hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R / Cmd+Shift+R).',
  },
  {
    q: 'What are the rules around fair play?',
    a: 'Any form of cheating, hacking, account sharing, or unsportsmanlike conduct results in immediate disqualification and a permanent ban from future Zenith Esports events. All matches are monitored and disputes are reviewed by the admin team. Match results are final once verified.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How do I dispute a match result?',
    a: 'Contact us on WhatsApp within 2 hours of the contested match. Include your team name, the opponent\'s team name, the match time, and any evidence (screenshots/recordings). Disputes submitted after the 2-hour window will not be accepted.',
